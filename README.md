# Bioprocess Modeling Project

This Jupyter Notebook contains course project developed during my Master's in Quantitative Biology. This project models a continuous bioreactor system exhibiting nonlinear dynamics due to substrate inhibition. We extend classical Monod kinetics with an inhibitory term and perform a detailed computational analysis using Python.

## Project: Nonlinear Dynamics in Bioreactors
- Substrate inhibition via extended Monod kinetics
- Steady-state analysis across dilution rates
- Phase-plane diagrams
- Productivity optimization
- Dynamic simulation with feedback **time delay**
- Sensitivity analysis for biological parameters
- Uses Python libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
